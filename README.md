# Instagram-account-tracker
This script can be used to keep track of specific Instagram profile without alerting the user. Also works for private accounts, you just need to be following them.
It's recommended to schedule this code to run once a day (can be done with Windows task scheduler).
This script tracks who was followed/unfollowed and also who followed/unfollowed tracked account.
Stories are also being saved locally.


After the script finishes, new information is displayed by a toast notofication:
